//! Shared setup for tests that need a real on-disk persistent backend and direct access to
//! [`TurboTasksBackend`] test hooks (`snapshot_and_evict_for_testing`, `parent_count_for_testing`,
//! …).
//!
//! These tests can't use `turbo_tasks_testing::register!`: that harness hands back an
//! `Arc<dyn TurboTasksApi>`, which erases the concrete backend type and makes `tt.backend()`
//! unreachable. It also owns the session loop (re-running the body and comparing results), whereas
//! these tests need to drive snapshots — and sometimes a DB reopen — on their own schedule.
//!
//! This module is compiled into each test binary separately, so any helper a given binary doesn't
//! call reads as dead code there.
