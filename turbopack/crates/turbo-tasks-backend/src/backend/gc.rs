//! Garbage collection for the persistent backend.

//! coordinator's GC phase (see
//! [`SnapshotCoordinator::begin_gc`](crate::backend::snapshot_coordinator)) — which excludes normal
//! operations — and is driven as a fully parallel, unbounded job pool
//! (see [`TurboTasksBackend::gc_collect`]).
//!
//! The GC-specific logic — job types, the pool driver, per-job teardown, and the pin/unpin
//! bookkeeping — as an `impl TurboTasksBackend`. Its entry points are called from `mod.rs`.

    ///   detector is per-context, so jobs on different threads holding different task guards do not
    ///   false-positive.
    /// - The storage map is a sharded dashmap: different tasks hit different shards; same-task
    ///   access is serialized by the shard lock. A `ScanShard` holds only a **read** lock on its
    ///   own shard, and a collect elsewhere in the map does not contend with it; a collect landing
    ///   on the shard being scanned simply waits for that shard's (short) read lock.
    /// - Interleaving the scan with the cascade cannot miss or double-collect. Nothing is missed:
    ///   every collectible task is reached either by the scan of the shard it lives in or by the
    ///   cascade that orphans it. Nothing is collected twice: a queued candidate can be collected
    ///   by a sibling job before its own `Collect` runs, so `Collect` re-validates
    ///   `is_gc_collectible` under its write guard and skips if the task is already `deleted` (or
    ///   has since regained an anchor).
    /// - The cascade decrement (`update_and_get_parent_count(-1)`) is a read-modify-write under the
    ///   child's entry write lock, so if two collected parents decrement the same child
    ///   concurrently, exactly one observes the count hit 0 and spawns its collect — no
    ///   double-collect, no lost decrement.
    /// - A collectible task has `parent_count == 0`, so no *surviving* task lists it as a child: a
    ///   task becomes a collect target only after its last persistent parent was itself collected
    ///   (which removed the edge). So a `Collect` never races a decrement of the same task and
    ///   never `ctx.task`-resurrects a task another job just removed.
