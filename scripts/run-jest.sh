# `__NEXT_EXPERIMENTAL_CI_SHARD` numbers the extra runs of the test matrix: CI
# runs the suites once plainly and again per shard, and a fixture keys an
# experimental flag on a shard number to cover both states of the flag —
# enabled by default, disabled in that shard:
#
#   experimental: {
#     useOffline: process.env.__NEXT_EXPERIMENTAL_CI_SHARD !== '1',
#   }
#
# paired with a `// @gate useOffline` on the suite: a plain run — including a
# local run with no special env — exercises the feature, and the shard run
# asserts it is inert when disabled (see test/lib/gate/README.md).
#
# For now there is a single shard, `1`, and it is an alias for
# `__NEXT_CACHE_COMPONENTS` (the `--experimental` run) rather than a CI
# dimension of its own. That works because most experiments hard-code
# `cacheComponents: true` in their fixture anyway — the cache-components env
# default only applies to fixtures that don't set it themselves, so for these
# fixtures that run is free to double as the shard run. Setting either name
# implies the other.
